# Day 1
This is day 1 of deploying every day and today I have a lot of work to do.
Yesterday instead of deploying like a grown up I decided to just run my project on my own machine but then the whole production went down because I turned off my computer when I was done with work.
So today I will deploy my code to a server instead. 
To start, I have to get a server running so I will download Debian, install it on a dedicated machine and set it up to run my Project.
```
Google "best linux server"
visit Debian website
download ISO
Install on Server
set up server?
go build
.\hello
```
